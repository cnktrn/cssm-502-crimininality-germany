## Closing Words

Now it is finally done, committed and pushed to the main branch.

Thank you Fuat, I want to express my gratitude to you and your effort. I really learned a lot this semester in your course!

Even though I have already been coding several projects in the past, this was my very first touchpoint with big data, data analysis and machine learning algorithms. Therefore, the contents of this projects have no predecessor.

## Additional Notes

Don't be scared by the amount of images in the /figures/fact sheet folder. Those are simply screenshots of the console output my code generates. At the first place, I wanted to include them in the appendix of my reports PDF, however that would have been too much.

If you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out to me at any time!

All the very best,
Can
